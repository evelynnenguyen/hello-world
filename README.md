#hello_world

I use this repository to save most of great things about Machine Learning from Google. Starting with basic concepts of ML, TensorFlow, or pandas, etc. to first steps to create my first ML app.

I created this repository as a place that aggregates things to learn for myself that I can trace back later. Moreover, for people who intend to learn ML as well and do not really know what to cover, I hope that this would somehow help a bit.

Have fun!
